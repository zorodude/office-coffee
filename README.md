# Timmy Time Two Thousand

A small app for an office to place coffee orders.

## History
A personal project as a means to learn Angular (2+), and some basic back-end.

The Backstory: Every Monday our office enjoys a round of coffee. An initial email @office goes out saying "place your orders", and is followed by 30 replies (all @office). This app aims to simplify the process by providing:
- a form to submit an order with
- a database to store orders in
- a checklist of retrieved orders

Tools used include: Angular, Node, Express, MongoDB



This project was generated with [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-beta.28.3.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build
Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.
